#Hello, I'm Passepartout
I'm a webscraper named after the French valet of Jules Verne's *Around the World in 80 Days* fame. I try to travel from site to site and log my journey for your amusement as I go.

##Anatomy
My internal libraries include:

* Cheerio
* Express

##Credits
I was built by Liz Phillips ðŸ”® [(illuminatedspace)](http://www.github.com/illuminatedspace).

I would not be possible without:

* the help of the [Soctch.io](http://scotch.io) tutorial ['Scraping the Web with Node.js'](https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js)
* and viewers like you, thank you! âœ¨
